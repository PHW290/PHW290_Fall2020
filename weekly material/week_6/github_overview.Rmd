Why Functions?

-  Save time (though the time saved is mostly in the future)
-  Reduce potential errors
-  Organize your code

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
covid_masks <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv")
# transform the never wear masks from percentages to a 5 category score
covid_masks$never_cat <- case_when(covid_masks$NEVER <= .2 ~ 1,
                                   covid_masks$NEVER <= .4 ~ 2,
                                   covid_masks$NEVER <= .6 ~ 3,
                                   covid_masks$NEVER <= .8 ~ 4,
                                   covid_masks$NEVER == TRUE ~ 5,)
# transform the rarely wear masks from percentages to a 5 category score
covid_masks$rarely_cat <- case_when(covid_masks$RARELY <= .2 ~ 1,
                                   covid_masks$RARELY <= .4 ~ 2,
                                   covid_masks$RARELY <= .6 ~ 3,
                                   covid_masks$RARELY <= .8 ~ 4,
                                   covid_masks$RARELY == TRUE ~ 5,)
